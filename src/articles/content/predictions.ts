**We have no way to read your thoughts.** All the text you write in the app never leaves your phone. 

Since we don't have an account system right now, we don't collect your email or phone number or any other obvious personally identifiable information.

If you don't believe us, you can always go look for yourself. As far as we know, **Knack's the only open source mental health app.**

As a disclaimer, we do record some anonymous analytics about certain features to make sure we haven't released a bug. If you're curious, there's more details on our website.
